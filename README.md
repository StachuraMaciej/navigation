The CSS is used to define the position of the navigation element, and the JavaScript is used to detect when the user has scrolled beyond a certain point and then trigger the CSS to "stick" the navigation element to the top or bottom of the window. Sticky navigation can improve website performance by reducing the need for users to repeatedly load and reload the navigation menu as they scroll up and down the page. Overall, sticky navigation is a useful and popular design technique that can help improve the user experience and engagement on a website.
